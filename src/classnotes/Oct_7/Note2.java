/*
* A variable is a symbolic name for an area of computer memory.
*
* Processing (and related languages: C, C++, and Java) is a "Strongly typed" language, ie. Every variable is associated
* by a specific data type. Once it is created, it cannot be changed.
*
*   Example: double vs integer (They are coded differently in memory)
*
* Data types fall into two categories in Java:
*   1)Primitive
*       built into the language
*
*   2)Reference aka "class types"
*       created by programmer
*
* There are 8 primitive types:
*
*   boolean     (has only two values: true/false)
*   char        (Stores single characters)
*
*   Numeric types:
*       Integer type:
*           byte    (range: -128 -> 127)
*           short
*           int
*           long
*       Floating Point types:
*           float
*           double
